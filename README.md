Hi there semi-sentient being and/or scraper!

I am James Ward. 
I am currently a student, a Computer Science major to be exact, at Appalachian State University (Go 'Neers!) who is pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree. 
I am a rising Senior, a former transfer with an Associate's Degree, and intend to graduate in December 2017.
I currently maintain a 3.53 GPA, have attained two academic scholarships (Sunshine Lady and SSTEM), regularly attend my school's hackathons and have recently completed my first research project.

My first research project was a team project through my scholarship. I worked in a team of 4 with a master's student, Nathan Hernandez (GitHub username: nathanph), as my leader and mentor. Together with my team I learned/learned about:
  - Hadoop/Spark - Jupyter - Docker - VirtualBox
  - Virtualizing with a machine
  - Ubuntu
  - GitHub/GitHub Archive
  - Machine Learning
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Python
  - and using/reading JSON
We then used this knowledge to together create a recommendation engine for GitHub repositories.

Which leads me to now, May/30/2016, yesterday we completed our base research, produced a product, and then presented our project to our peers within our scholarship. Today I begin the process of uploading our final product, documenting the steps we took, and possible improving our product further as my first GitHub process. It feels rather ironic that my first product on GitHub will be a product for GitHub. Hopefully one day it might have been that very engine which brought you here. 

I appreciate your time,
James.
